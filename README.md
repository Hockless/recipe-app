## Welcome to your Expo app ðŸ‘‹

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

### Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go)

You can start developing by editing the files inside the `app` directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

### Reset to a blank app

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the `app-example` directory and create a blank `app` directory where you can start developing.
